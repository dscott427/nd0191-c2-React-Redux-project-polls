# Employee Polls Project

This is the my final assessment project for Udacity's React & Redux course. The application let's users create, answer, and track polls created by employees.

The application uses a simple user id and password to autheticate and login the user. No navigation is vailable until user is successfully logged on.

Functionality:

* Login/Logout
* Dashboard - default after login
* Add - Create a new poll
* Question - Answer a poll
* Leaderboard - Show answered and created metrics for each use and rank

Please use the following commands to install, run, and test the project
* npm install - update npm packages
* npm start - Run the application
* npm run test - Run the tests

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:
